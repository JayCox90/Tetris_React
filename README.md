Game works best in Browsers, but has mobile Design as well

## Functionalities I added:
- Upcoming Tetromino Stage 
- Pocket Tetromino Stage and according Game Functionality
- Pause / Continue Button
- Instant Drop 
- Theme Changer
- Media Query Setup for Mobile with clickable/touchable buttons to play. 



### Maybe functionalities for later:
- Saving selected Theme in cookies/local storage for next time
- add Backend for Leader Board
- Options to change controls and store in local storage or via User in Backend
