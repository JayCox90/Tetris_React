Game works best in Browsers, but has mobile Design as well
Try it here: https://jaycox90.github.io/Tetris_React/

## Functionalities I added:
- Upcoming Tetromino Stage 
- Pocket Tetromino Stage and according Game Functionality
- Pause / Continue Button
- Instant Drop 
- Theme Changer
- Media Query Setup for Mobile with clickable/touchable buttons to play. 



### Maybe functionalities for later:
- Saving selected Theme in cookies/local storage for next time
- add Backend for Leader Board
- Options to change controls and store in local storage or via User in Backend


The performance on the mobile design is a bit funky, depending on device, but since this is not really meant to be played, I am putting investigation on optimizations on hold. Also mobile styling could use a bit more work as well as implementation of the scoring, but for now I will leave it as is. 

I hope you enjoy. I spent more time playing this game than I am going to admit.
